Dyspraxia (DCD) Motor Coordination Risk – Repurposed Dataset
-----------------------------------------------------------

Source:
Original Dysgraphia Handwriting Dataset

Reframing:
This dataset has been repurposed for *motor coordination risk screening*
related to Dyspraxia / Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD).

Label Mapping:
- Low Potential Dysgraphia  -> Mild Motor Coordination Risk
- Potential Dysgraphia      -> High Motor Coordination Risk

Important:
- This dataset is intended ONLY for early screening / research purposes.
- It does NOT provide clinical diagnosis.
- Cognitive and linguistic errors are ignored; only motor patterns are used.

Recommended Use:
- CNN-based handwriting image classification
- Labels: Mild Risk, High Risk
